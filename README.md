# Web-deploy 

Ansible repository to deploy the static web server on AWS

While designing the solution my first though was how can I divide the tasks into multiple subtask which can be written in roles

Therefore, I divided the static web-app deployment into two steps

1. Creation of instratrcture 

2. Deployment of web-app

In the creation of the infrastructire I need information about how to create VM on AWS cloud.
